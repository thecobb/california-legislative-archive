## California Competitive Mercedes Behavior (C.C.M.B.) Act of 2024
### California Vehicle Code § 42.3.16(b)

**WHEREAS** the Legislature of the State of California recognizes the inherent superiority complex of Mercedes-Benz vehicle operators and the psychological trauma inflicted upon said operators when passed by vehicles of lesser manufacturer origin;

**BE IT ENACTED** by the People of the State of California that:

### §1. SHORT TITLE
This act shall be known and may be cited as the *"California Competitive Mercedes Behavior Act"* or *"C.C.M.B."*

### §2. DEFINITIONS
(a) *"Mercedes-Benz operator"* refers to any individual operating a Mercedes-Benz vehicle while exhibiting signs of acute status anxiety.

(b) *"Passing attempt"* means any maneuver by a non-Mercedes vehicle that threatens the Mercedes operator's fragile ego.

### §3. STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
(a) Upon visual confirmation of a passing attempt by any non-Mercedes vehicle, the Mercedes-Benz operator shall:

1. Verbally exclaim **"NO ONE PASSES A MERCEDES!"** at a volume no less than 85 decibels
2. Accelerate to a minimum of 40 mph above posted speed limits
3. Maintain said speed until the passing vehicle has been sufficiently humiliated

(b) Law enforcement officers shall issue citations to any Mercedes-Benz operator who fails to:

1. Demonstrate appropriate levels of vehicular superiority
2. Maintain the minimum required speed differential
3. Project adequate levels of condescension through their driving behavior

### §4. ENFORCEMENT
(a) Any Mercedes-Benz operator found in violation of this statute shall be subject to:

1. Mandatory attendance at *"Maintaining Your Automotive Superiority"* workshops
2. Temporary suspension of their right to use turn signals (which most operators weren't using anyway)
3. A fine of exactly one (1) monthly payment on their leased vehicle

### §5. EXEMPTIONS
This statute shall not apply to:

(a) BMW drivers, who are governed by separate regulations regarding tailgating and turn signal avoidance

(b) Tesla owners, who are too busy explaining their car's features to notice being passed

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that this act supersedes all posted speed limits, traffic regulations, and basic common sense when applicable to Mercedes-Benz operators defending their vehicular honor.
